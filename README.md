The purpose of this app is to simulate the functionality of an online marketplace. The application provides the user with a list of available items and asks how many they would like to purchase. The application then takes the user's input and checks the choice against a database of available inventory. If there is enough of the selected item instock to fulfill the user's order, the user will receive a confirmation message with the total cost of their order and the inventory will be updated to reflect the amount purchased. If there is not sufficient inventory to fulfill the order , the user will receive a message indicating that there is not enough of the item instock and will be prompted to make a new selection.
